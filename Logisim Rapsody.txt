Is this the real ALU...
Or it's just another AiAlu...?
Stuck in the laboratory,
Whith no internet connection...
Open the proxy,
Start up GITHUB and you'll see...

I'm only a poor student that uses logisim,
Easy to use, easy to crash
Little weight, high implementation...
Whatever direciton the current flows,
it's not really important for Java...
Ahimè...

I see a little shiluette of a Commit...
OH MY GOD OH MY GOD will you do the sync-up?!
Packet loss and Caronte, very terrifing!!
Will it corrupt?
[Chorus] I hope not!
Will it corrupt?
[Chorus] I hope not!
Will it corruuuuupt?
NONONONONONONO!
Oh my commit, oh my commit, please please do not corrupt.
Linus keeps a Linux distro for meeeee
For meeee
For meeeeeeeee
